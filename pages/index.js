						<p>
							The VIS Arts Program (VISAP) is a mini-conference and exhibition where visualization researchers,
							designers, and artists come together to showcase and discuss works at the intersection of data
							visualization, art and design. It is the biggest associated event in the{" "}
							<a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2022/welcome">IEEE VIS conference</a>, and its main goal is to foster new
							thinking, discussion, and collaboration across and between fields of research and practice.
						</p>
						<p>
							VISAP welcomes a wide range of submissions, including interactive artworks, design projects, novel
							visualization tools and applications, art-science or artist-in-lab projects, critical interpretations and
							evaluations of data visualizations, and philosophical meditations on the intersections between art and
							research. These can either be submitted to a paper track, or to an exhibition track (see details below).
