Throughout history, data from the Universe has been employed to uncover the existence of unseen worlds, the Cosmos. The discoveries gleaned from the process have influenced numerous sectors of our humanity, communicated through various languages and approaches. Scientists use numerical data and textual explanations to communicate information about the Cosmos. On the other hand, artists use sensory media, such as visuals and sounds, to narrate the story of the Cosmos. This art project aims to manifest the continuous and timeless presence of the Universe where it surrounds humanity, employing artistic transformation of universe data to illuminate its enduring existence. \\n\\nThe sidereal periods of the eight planets are the raw data. These relative orbital periods were transformed into eight distinct sound loops, each with its unique cycle. This transformation was accomplished through the installation system incorporating algorithms. While producing a soundtrack, changes in the sound influence the visualization.

Alfaguara, 2021; Caja Negra, 2023), by Chilean author Sim\xf3n L\xf3pez Trujillo, a mycologist analyses the way a certain fungus infects the mind of a forest worker called Pedro. An abstract image of countless white dots against a black background, in the form of waves or a mountain range, appears to explain the infection: the genetic origin of Pedro’s language, when the fungus starts speaking through him. \\nThat image, included in the revised edition of the book, is also a depiction of the novel’s genetic origin, as it was generated by a visualization of different drafts of the novel. In every literary reading, two texts are involved: the actual text, that we can smoothly read with our eyes, and a second, invisible text, made of all the deletions, editions, and additions of words involved in the process of writing. This project conceives the visualization of The Vast Territory as a visual novel on its own that explores the unconscious of the book: that black, secret space, where the words involved in the writing process emerge as ghostly presences. There, the data of the previous draft are manifested in the following one, as a latent presence in the actuality of the text we read.\\nIn this work, every white dot represents a word in the juxtaposed draft sequence. Its construction follows only two straightforward rules: (1) words are sequentially arranged in a horizontal line; (2) the vertical position of each word-dot is determined by its initial appearance within the entire sequence of drafts. The result is a “data-palimpsest” where each draft leaves its imprint on the next through their cumulative determination of the spatial order. By using the order of first appearance as the guiding principle, the visualisation emphasises the inherited structure of each draft from its predecessors, akin to looking at the fossil record or geological strata, with the most ancient elements appearing at the greatest depth.","Webpage":"the-vast-territory.baltazarperez.com","Artwork caption":"This visualization shows the overview, and runs through every word in order, of the juxtaposed 4-draft sequence of the novel The Vast Territory, by Chilean author Sim\xf3n L\xf3pez Trujillo.

Artists created a book that explored the idea of organic and machine-made interpretations of a place that were generate using 3 different processes: a generative adversarial network, traditional printmaking and a camera. The artists found the results unexpected, discussing how the AI-generated image changed and complicated their understanding and constructed narrative about the original image and space. This caused them to think outside the box with over half of the students changing their print matrix and/or ink choices after seeing their AI-generated image. This supported the learning objective for students to collaborate with technology that is uninhibited by perspective or expectation, adapting and responding productively and creatively within a new framework. With the newfound accessibility to AI-generated images we encourage art teachers to explore how it fits into their curriculum.","Artwork caption":"We explore organic spaces via print, bookmaking, data, and ML.

Four different scenes are animated, with the camera panning slowly from left to right. Viewers can observe how the plastics are decomposed at a slower speed by looking at particle animations. In collaboration with engineers at Yonsei University, reverse neural network algorithms were applied to create style transferred images and those images were used for textures for surreal 3D objects in the world-making process. In doing so, the piece raises awareness about microplastics, which are a cause of environmental issues in the present day. Data like different types of plastics and speed of decomposition are applied in this animation and sound design. This scene animation is inspired by Ilwalobongbyeong (a folding screen) behind the king’s throne of the Joseon Dynasty. This animation depicts the twist of the landscape. Surreal objects/buildings in this animation made from plastic look beautiful and mesmerizing at first glance. However, the viewers can notice that they are the decayed objects and destroyed nature impacted by human beings. This new multi-sensory artwork addresses the awareness of plastic pollution through the apocalyptic lens. \\nThis work explores how humans and non-humans can be mingled in the plastic-impacted situations with an artistic lens and critical point of view.

Similar to the arts, the means to study and document such biographical inscription processes are under constant development: From the heroic accounts of Renaissance artists to feminist visualizations of co-existing urban subjects we have seen the arts and humanities’ methods portfolio evolve.\\n\\nIn this context, the artwork showcases how the intangible and ephemeral lives of artists can be brought into the physical presence of material exhibition spaces. To that end, it builds on the visualization framework of time geography and remodels biographies diagrammatically as three-dimensional trajectories, drawing unique curves into a translucent space-time sculpture.\\n\\nFocusing on the life and work of the Austrian painter Herwig Zens (1943-2019), the data sculpture shows major steps and movements of his career. Over many decades, Zens kept a multimodal diary and etched logbook-like notes on art projects and his teaching activities, encounters with other artists, collectors and gallery owners, as well as travel impressions on copper plates. A complete print of the diary from 2005—which Zens referred to as “monster” due to its sheer informational and productional complexity—is considered the longest etching in the world at 40 meters.

Technological advancements create ample avenues, like social medias, for individuals to articulate themselves and record emotions. However, the sense of loneliness has never vanished, as their expressions are easily buried in the digital stream. We analyze social media posts that express loneliness during holiday seasons but receive few responses. By superimposing digital charts on physical models, we visualize these lonely posts and generate the island of loneliness. We aim to reveal the complexities of human emotions in the digital age and reflect on the interconnections between technology, solitude, and social communication.","Webpage":"https://osf.io/3kt8d/","Artwork caption":"Social media post acts as a metaphorical stone cast into the data sea, with some carrying significant weight, size, or other captivating features that generate continuous ripples and water flowers, sparking mass responses within the crowd.

Frames are selected at regular intervals along the linear interpolation of images from the generative model, such that light from below is still able to permeate up to the viewer. The aggregated effect of these layered video frames results in an eerie visual sensation of peering down at a forested landscape that is being submerged in water. Surrounding the prism is a haphazardly piled 120ft.
