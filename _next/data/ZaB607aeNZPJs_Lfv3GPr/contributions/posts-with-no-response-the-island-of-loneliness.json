{"pageProps":{"data":{"Contribution ID":1074,"Contribution Type":"Artwork and Pictorial","Title":"Posts with No Response: The Island of Loneliness","Description":"Loneliness and isolation are eternal emotions in human beings. Technological advancements create ample avenues, like social medias, for individuals to articulate themselves and record emotions. However, the sense of loneliness has never vanished, as their expressions are easily buried in the digital stream. We analyze social media posts that express loneliness during holiday seasons but receive few responses. By superimposing digital charts on physical models, we visualize these lonely posts and generate the island of loneliness. We aim to reveal the complexities of human emotions in the digital age and reflect on the interconnections between technology, solitude, and social communication.","Webpage":"https://osf.io/3kt8d/","Format(s)":"installation","Material(s)":"wood","Dimensions (if applicable)":"50cm × 50cm × 10cm","Year of creation":2023,"id":"posts-with-no-response-the-island-of-loneliness","next":"eco-mending","prev":"parasitic-signals-coexistence-with-the-sars-cov-2-virus","images":[{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 1 (File responses)/model - Junxiu Tang.jpg","imageCaption":"The physical model of the loneliness island.","width":6000,"height":4000},{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 2 (File responses)/projection - Junxiu Tang.jpg","imageCaption":"The complete installation.","width":4032,"height":3024},{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 3 (File responses)/overview - Junxiu Tang.jpg","imageCaption":"Projection onto the physical model.","width":3024,"height":3024},{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 4 (File responses)/detail - Junxiu Tang.jpg","imageCaption":"The island's highest point, representing the popular topics related to loneliness.","width":4032,"height":3024},{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 5 (File responses)/ripple - Junxiu Tang.jpg","imageCaption":"Ripples indicate the presence of responded posts when the unanswered posts sediment into the seabed.","width":2065,"height":2065}],"authors":[{"id":"1074-junxiu-tang","nameSurname":"Junxiu Tang","website":"https://ahugh19.github.io/","bio":"Junxiu Tang is a 5th-year Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at Zhejiang University, affiliated with the State Key Lab of CAD&CG and Interactive Data Group under the guidance of Prof. Yingcai Wu.
