{"pageProps":{"data":{"Contribution ID":1056,"Contribution Type":"Artwork","Title":"Plastic Landscape - The Reversible World","Description":"\"Plastic Landscape - The Reversible World\" is an AI-generated 3D animated video design that shows the apocalyptic and surreal world surrounded by artificial plastic mixtures and objects in the ocean, urban city, Antarctica, and forest. Four different scenes are animated, with the camera panning slowly from left to right. Viewers can observe how the plastics are decomposed at a slower speed by looking at particle animations. In collaboration with engineers at Yonsei University, reverse neural network algorithms were applied to create style transferred images and those images were used for textures for surreal 3D objects in the world-making process. In doing so, the piece raises awareness about microplastics, which are a cause of environmental issues in the present day. Data like different types of plastics and speed of decomposition are applied in this animation and sound design. This scene animation is inspired by Ilwalobongbyeong (a folding screen) behind the kingâ€™s throne of the Joseon Dynasty. This animation depicts the twist of the landscape. Surreal objects/buildings in this animation made from plastic look beautiful and mesmerizing at first glance. However, the viewers can notice that they are the decayed objects and destroyed nature impacted by human beings. This new multi-sensory artwork addresses the awareness of plastic pollution through the apocalyptic lens. \nThis work explores how humans and non-humans can be mingled in the plastic-impacted situations with an artistic lens and critical point of view. The piece brings audiences face to face with the reality of climate change, while at the same time foreboding a future that has been destroyed by microplastics; the piece will inspire audiences to take action of their own accord.","Webpage":"http://yoonchunghan.com/portfolio/plasticlandscape.html","Format(s)":"Multi channel video installation","Material(s)":"Video installation","Year of creation":2023,"id":"plastic-landscape---the-reversible-world","next":"monster-in-a-snow-globe-biographies-as-data-physicalizations","prev":"reinterpreted-spaces-an-ai-printmaking-collaboration","images":[{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 1 (File responses)/Plastic_Landscape_YHan_Representative_Image - Yoon Chung han.jpg","imageCaption":"\"Plastic Landscape - The Reversible World\" by Yoon Chung Han ","width":3840,"height":2160},{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 2 (File responses)/A007C003_210113XC.00_11_14_29.Still036 - Yoon Chung han.jpg","imageCaption":"\"Plastic Landscape - The Reversible World\" by Yoon Chung Han ","width":3840,"height":2160},{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 3 (File responses)/A007C003_210113XC.00_11_30_01.Still037 - Yoon Chung han.jpg","imageCaption":"\"Plastic Landscape - The Reversible World\" by Yoon Chung Han ","width":3840,"height":2160},{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 4 (File responses)/Plastic_Landscape_YHan_Website - Yoon Chung han.jpg","imageCaption":"\"Plastic Landscape - The Reversible World\" by Yoon Chung Han ","width":3840,"height":2160},{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 5 (File responses)/Plastic_Landscape_01 - Yoon Chung han.jpg","imageCaption":"\"Plastic Landscape - The Reversible World\" by Yoon Chung Han ","width":3840,"height":2160},{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 6 (File responses)/Plastic_Landscape_05 - Yoon Chung han.png","imageCaption":"\"Plastic Landscape - The Reversible World\" by Yoon Chung Han ","width":3456,"height":1944},{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 7 (File responses)/YoonChungHan_PlasticLandscape_07 - Yoon Chung han.png","imageCaption":"\"Plastic Landscape - The Reversible World\" by Yoon Chung Han ","width":3292,"height":1842},{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 8 (File responses)/YoonChungHan_PlasticLandscape_09 - Yoon Chung han.png","imageCaption":"\"Plastic Landscape - The Reversible World\" by Yoon Chung Han ","width":3294,"height":1842},{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 9 (File responses)/Plastic_Landscape_02 - Yoon Chung han.jpg","imageCaption":"\"Plastic Landscape - The Reversible World\" by Yoon Chung Han ","width":3840,"height":2160}],"authors":[{"id":"1056-yoon-chung-han","nameSurname":"Yoon Chung Han","website":"http://yoonchunghan.com/portfolio/index.html","bio":"Yoon Chung Han is an interactive media artist and award-winning interaction designer.
