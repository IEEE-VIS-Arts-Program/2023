{"pageProps":{"data":{"Contribution ID":1086,"Contribution Type":"Artwork","Title":"Mixtures of Human Experience, Intellectual Analysis, Data Representation and Our Natural Environment","Description":"As humans, we are perpetually present in nature. We experience\nnature through sensory perception of everything that surrounds us:\nthe breeze on our skin, the warmth of the sun, the scent of flowering\nplants, the tactile variations in the surfaces of our environment. We are\nconstantly decoding and assimilating the clues our natural environment\nprovides through sensory experiences.\nIn contrast, expression of environmental and climate-based change\nthrough data measurement and analysis separates us from the sensory\nexperience of our immediate environment. The current simulations and\ndepictions of climate change data – ocean chemistry, coupled ecosystem\nmodels, the atmosphere far above and the ocean currents far below –\nare viewed as separate from our personal environments: distant, not\npart of us, not connected to us, and unrelated to our perpetually present\nsensory experience.\nThe separation of our emotional connection to nature from our\nintellectual study inhibits our ability to absorb the growing impact\non our daily lives. The work presented here seeks be a conduit assisting\nus to close the gap between our human emotional connection to nature\nfrom our intellectual study and the sterile analytical imagery we use to\nunderstand the invisible physical changes underway.\nWe rely on the interplay of art, technology and science, and the\ndance of these disciplines as they augment one another to create an\nemotional connection between the audience and the data. Prior work\nfocused on building out artistic vocabulary for clear, engaging science\nexploration and communication. The series presented here, melds the\nscience inquiry, data representation, artistic contextual content to create\nnew layers of meaning and connection.\n","Webpage":"https://sites.utexas.edu/artscivis/","Format(s)":"print","Material(s)":"paper and ink","Dimensions (if applicable)":"48' x 18'","Year of creation":2022,"id":"mixtures-of-human-experience-intellectual-analysis-data-representation-and-our-natural-environment","next":"waiting-for-the-wave-in-metaverse","prev":"associative-forms-for-encoding-multivariate-climate-data","images":[{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 1 (File responses)/CarbonGulf - Francesca Samsel.png","imageCaption":"Carbon Tracks, uses data and illustration to speak to nitrate levels in the Gulf of Mexico.","width":2400,"height":900},{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 2 (File responses)/CarbonGulf_low_res - Francesca Samsel.png","imageCaption":"Combination of biogeochemistry data in the Gulf of Mexico with illustration, Oxygen speaks of the extended reach of hypoxic ecosystems.","width":1000,"height":375},{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 3 (File responses)/QuietPlankton4 - Francesca Samsel.png","imageCaption":"Sargassum, references the 5000 mile wide swath of toxic bloom washing onto coastal regions across two continents.","width":3000,"height":2000},{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 4 (File responses)/Dispruptions - Francesca Samsel.png","imageCaption":"Disruptions, speaks of ecosystem disruptions being driven by microscopic organisms.","width":3300,"height":2400}],"authors":[{"id":"1086-francesca-samsel","nameSurname":"Francesca Samsel","website":"https://sites.utexas.edu/artscivis/","bio":"Focusing on multidisciplinary collaboration, Francesca Samsel, trained as an artist , is a Research Scientist at the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas at Austin, collaborates with environmental scientists, scientific visualization research teams to apply an artistic voice and language to the science that underpins the climate challenges of this generation.
