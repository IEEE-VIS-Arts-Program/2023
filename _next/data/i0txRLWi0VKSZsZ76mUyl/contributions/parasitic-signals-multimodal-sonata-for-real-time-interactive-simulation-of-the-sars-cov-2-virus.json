{"pageProps":{"data":{"Contribution ID":1069,"Contribution Type":"Paper","Title":"Parasitic signals: Multimodal Sonata for Real-time Interactive Simulation of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus","Description":"This project aims to transform the nano-scale of a striking biological phenomenon, the relationship between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and human molecules, into an interactive audiovisual simulation. In this work, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) touching and imaging a single molecule measures the interaction between the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and human cellular proteins and measures the dynamic of the spike protein. We create a comprehensive scientific model based on diverse datasets and theories presenting a real-time interactive complex system with efficient rendering and sonification using a single C++ platform. This project invites the audience into an immersive space where they can control the behavior of biomolecules, allowing them to intuitively perceive biological properties. This project is not only a demonstration of scientific data but also attempts to look at the interspecies relationship in parasitism which particularly deals with our current and post-pandemic life with coronavirus and how we might control our coexistence in a virtual space.","Webpage":"https://www.myunginlee.com/covid","id":"parasitic-signals-multimodal-sonata-for-real-time-interactive-simulation-of-the-sars-cov-2-virus","next":"parasitic-signals-coexistence-with-the-sars-cov-2-virus","prev":"bitter-data-an-exploration-into-data-edibilization-of-negative-emotion","images":[{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 1 (File responses)/01 - Myungin Ben Lee.jpg","imageCaption":"Installation of Coexistence with the SARS-CoV-2 virus","width":7979,"height":4550},{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 2 (File responses)/02 - Myungin Ben Lee.jpeg","imageCaption":"From (a) spike trimer of the SARS-CoV-2 virus observed with AFM to (f) rendered dynamic spikes with the labels ","width":4000,"height":2400},{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 3 (File responses)/03 - Myungin Ben Lee.png","imageCaption":"Schematic image of components in the simulation with the actual sizes","width":519,"height":562},{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 4 (File responses)/04 - Myungin Ben Lee.jpg","imageCaption":"Overall structure of multimodal design","width":2550,"height":1772},{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 5 (File responses)/05 - Myungin Ben Lee.jpg","imageCaption":"Four stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection toward the lung along the airway: Appearance, Diffusion, Penetration, and Binding for Entry","width":3844,"height":813},{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 6 (File responses)/06 - Myungin Ben Lee.jpg","imageCaption":"Linear-scale spectrogram of an exemplary narrative over 4 minutes","width":3061,"height":1241},{"src":"images/contributions-images/Image 7 (File responses)/07 - Myungin Ben Lee.png","imageCaption":"The installations are made in various environments and diverse audiences are invited for the interaction.","width":572,"height":996}],"authors":[{"id":"1069-myungin-lee","nameSurname":"Myungin Lee","website":"https://www.myunginlee.com/","bio":"Dr. Myungin Lee is a researcher designing multimodal instruments based on scientific theory, composition, signal processing, machine learning, and gestural interface.
